I'm a [Full-Breadth Developer](https://justin.searls.co/posts/full-breadth-developers/) leveraging my experience as a [ICAEW](https://www.icaew.com/) Chartered Accountant to build specialized solutions for the finance industry, ranging from data analytics to automations and agentic AI.

I'm also a very keen rock climber that enjoys the disciplines of Sport, Bouldering and Trad. My proudest send is on-sighting an [E1 5b](https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/crags/avon_gorge_suspension_bridge_area-47/howhard-29931) multi-pitch route.

Beyond that, I'm a very proud father of a wonderful and bright toddler.
